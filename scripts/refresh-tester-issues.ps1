We are looking for volunteer testers for AegisLoop.

AegisLoop connects one ChatGPT conversation to one local Codex session through a guarded local bridge. Right now we need real-world compatibility reports across browsers, operating systems, and ChatGPT model modes.

No coding is required. Most reports take 5-10 minutes.

## Pick one path

- Windows + Chrome
- Windows + Edge
- Windows + Brave
- macOS + Chrome
- macOS + Edge
- Chinese ChatGPT UI labels
- GPT-5.5 / GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.3 / o3 model menu behavior

## What to check

1. The AegisLoop panel appears on ChatGPT.
2. The local bridge shows online.
3. Switching ChatGPT model mode does not change the ChatGPT conversation route.
4. The same ChatGPT conversation stays connected to the same local Codex session.
5. If something blocks the test, the panel or script reports a clear reason such as `login_required`, `browser_challenge`, `model_option_not_found`, `leader_conflict`, or `bridge_timeout`.

## Report template

Please comment with:

```text
OS:
Browser:
ChatGPT UI language:
AegisLoop version:
Model mode tested:
Result: pass / partial / blocked
What happened:
Sanitized Debug Snapshot or screenshot:
```

## Safety

Please do not include real conversation IDs, tokens, local private paths, private workspace names, or private project content. If you include a screenshot, crop or blur anything private.

If you want to help, comment with the one path you can test. Thank you!

__TASK_COMMENT_MARKER__

This is a no-code testing task.

Time: about 5-10 minutes.

Please pick one browser / OS / model path, run the check, and paste this report:

```text
OS:
Browser:
ChatGPT UI language:
AegisLoop version:
Model mode tested:
Result: pass / partial / blocked
What happened:
Sanitized Debug Snapshot or screenshot:
```

What counts as done:

- one clear pass / partial / blocked result;
- enough detail for a maintainer to reproduce or understand the behavior;
- no real conversation IDs, tokens, local private paths, private workspace names, or private project content.
